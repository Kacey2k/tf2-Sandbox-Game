# [GMS2] TF2 Sandbox Game
 A 2D Sandbox Game that mimics TeamFortress 2.

 Currently Unfinished, however, you may take a look and play with the code that exists if you like.

# Current Issues
- Muzzle Flashes placed where they may not make most sense for some entities due to code inheritance.
- Buildings Do Not have max Health when upgraded, a check for if it has been damaged before upgrading will be added in the future.
- Medics on rare occassion will get stuck in Uber when pocketing another Medic.
- Snipers can sometimes ignore walls when scoped.
- Snipers can sometimes get stuck in the scoped state.
- Caught engineer phasing through a wall, did not catch what he was doing to do so. Isolated Engie running many tests to try and get him to do it again, and was not successful. Hopefully will be identified & fixed before official release.
