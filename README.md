# [GMS2] TF2box
 A 2D Sandbox Game that mimics TF2.

 Currently Unfinished, however, you may take a look and play with the code that exists if you like.

# Current Issues
- [MAJOR] NPCs can phase through obstacles during combat due to how the combat movement currently works.
- NPC shadows do not render at the correct position.
- Engineer Building/Repair movement limited if an obstacle intersects building location.
